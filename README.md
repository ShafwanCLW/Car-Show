This project, part of a computer graphics assignment, focuses on animating an articulated or hierarchical model in its natural setting.
An articulated model is comprised of interconnected parts, each moving in synchronization under constraints to mimic real-world motion.
Our chosen model demonstrates complex movements and relationships between its components, showcasing advanced programming techniques in 
computer graphics.

Key Features : 
Hierarchical Model: We selected a detailed articulated model (e.g., robotic arm, planetary system) with natural and interconnected movements of its parts.
Transformation Techniques: Utilized advanced transformation operations like scaling, translation, and rotation to simulate realistic motion.
Synchronization: Seamlessly synchronized the movement of each part using PushMatrix and PopMatrix functions, ensuring a cohesive and natural animation.
Lighting and Materials: Enhanced the model's appearance with lighting effects and material properties, offering interactive options to modify these settings.
Interactive Control: Implemented interactive controls using keyboard and mouse inputs to manipulate various parameters of the model, such as angles of rotation and movement directions.
