Articulated Car Model Animation Project

This project, as part of a computer graphics assignment, showcases the animation of an articulated car model in a simulated environment. Our focus was on creating a detailed and realistically articulated car, demonstrating natural movements and relationships between its parts. This project exemplifies advanced techniques in computer graphics programming, including the use of hierarchical models and transformation operations.

Key Features
Articulated Car Model: A complex, articulated car model with interconnected parts that move synchronously, mimicking real-world car dynamics.
Advanced Transformation Techniques: Employed scaling, translation, and rotation operations to simulate the car's realistic movements.
Synchronization and Interactivity: Integrated PushMatrix and PopMatrix functions for seamless synchronization of movements. Implemented interactive controls for users to manipulate model parameters like rotation angles and movement directions.
Enhanced Visuals: Utilized lighting effects and material properties to enhance the model's appearance, with interactive options for users to modify these settings.
Contextual Environment: Added surrounding objects like a floating grid, ground, and rings to create a compelling and contextual scene for the car model.
